## Changelog
(most recent first)

### v0.3.1 2018-03-03:
* Removed unexpected indent in the line calling TwigPen.

### v0.3 2018-03-03:
* Added post to Twitter, using my TwigPen Twython wrapper.

### v0.2.4 2018-03-02:
* Tidied code to authorise with pnut.io only if there's a notification to make.

### v0.2.3 2018-02-21:
* Bugfix: Application works as-intended after correcting the logic of the test for a file containing the last published date.

### v0.2.2 2018-02-20:
* Bugfix: After the first run, the base file contents were erased; this no longer happens. Crude fix.
* v0.2.1 was released on 2018-02-20, not the 19th.

### v0.2.1 2018-02-20:
* Bugfix: Now saves latest post time over base file contents when there's a new post; previous script repeatedly looked at the same old post - hourly! Thanks @33MHz.

### v0.2 2018-02-19:
* Changed from sending public messages to sending public posts. Note: application not tested with a blog post prior to this change.
* Removed unnecessary print command.

### v0.1 2018-02-16:
* Changed from examining 10 posts to just the most recent one. The intention is to run this as a cron job every hour (perhaps 2); it's unlikely I'll create a blog post more frequently.
* Added the creation of a message in my pnut.io dev channel if a new blog post exists.
* Next step: must create a new pnut.io app to create an independent token. (Currently borrowing the one from `crypto`!)

### v0.0 2018-02-15:
* First commit with basic functionality
 * Gets most recent 10 posts from feed.
 * Saves them to a file for later comparison with historic posts.
 * If the 'base' file doesn't exist, also saves the most recent 10 posts to a file for later comparison with more recent posts.
